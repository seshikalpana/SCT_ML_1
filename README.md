This project demonstrates how Linear Regression can be used to build a predictive model using a real-world dataset. Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables (features) and a continuous dependent variable (target). It works by fitting a straight line (in simple regression) or a hyperplane (in multiple regression) that best represents the data.
In this project, we:
Loaded and explored the dataset
Performed basic data preprocessing
Split the data into training and testing sets
Built a Linear Regression model
Trained the model using the training dataset
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as R² Score, MAE, and RMSE
Visualized the regression line along with scatter plots
Generated predictions for the test data
This project demonstrates how linear regression can be used for prediction tasks such as price estimation, score prediction, and other numeric outputs.
